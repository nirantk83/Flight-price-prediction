PURPOSE â€“

1] TO PREDICT THE FLIGHT PRICE BY LEARNING PEVIOUS DATA

2] VISUALISATION 

3] BUILDING THE MODEL


CONCLUSION-
   A]PREPROCESSING: IN THIS DATASET THERE ARE SOME UNRELATED FEATURE WHICH ARE NOT RELATED WITH TARGET FEATURE SO WE REMOVED THAT FEATURE
    AFTER THAT SOME FEATURE ARE IN OBJECT FORMET.BEFORE APPLYING MODEL ONNTHIS DATASETNWE CONVERT OBJECT FORMAT INTO INT BY LABLE ENCODING
   
   A] BUILDING MODEL: AFTER LABLE ENCODING WE SPLIT THE DATA INTO X & Y AND APPLY LINEAR REGRESSION ON THS DATASET BEACOSE DATASET TARGET COLUMN IS IN CONTINUES

   
RESULT



1] Overall Accuracy of Model was 91% 
2] BASICALLY AFTER THAT I TOOK  SOME PARAMETER FROM USER AND PREDICT FLIGHT PRICE BASEDON INPUT DATA
